Exploring the Abstract Factory Pattern in Golang with SportsFactory

Design patterns are essential tools for any software developer. They provide proven solutions to common problems, ensuring code is maintainable, scalable, and robust. One such pattern is the Abstract Factory Pattern. In this blog post, we'll dive into the Abstract Factory Pattern using an example from the Learning-LLD-Using-Golang repository, specifically focusing on the SportsFactory.
What is the Abstract Factory Pattern?

The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is particularly useful when the exact types and dependencies of the objects are not known until runtime or when you need to ensure that the objects are created in a consistent manner.
Structure of the SportsFactory Example

In the SportsFactory example, the pattern is used to create different types of sports equipment. The main components of this implementation are:

    Abstract Factory Interface: Defines the methods for creating abstract products.
    Concrete Factories: Implement the abstract factory interface to create concrete products.
    Abstract Product Interfaces: Declare interfaces for different types of products.
    Concrete Products: Implement the abstract product interfaces.

Let's break down the code step-by-step.
Abstract Factory Interface

The abstract factory interface, SportsFactory, defines the methods for creating sports equipment:

```
type SportsFactory interface {
    MakeShoe() Shoe
    MakeShirt() Shirt
}
```
